The Team Paris website contains the profiles of three different CSC 174 students. Each profile has a picture of the student, as well as   a breif "about me" section and a story of how they came to do what they do.

##Taxonomy:  
 Each page, aside from the intro page, is focused on an  individual team member.  

##Choreography:  
 The pages are in order of student by alphabetical order (first name,) and the content on each profile page  (aside from the intro  section) is in chronological order.

		<h2>About Margaret</h2>

			<p>I am an ex-student at the University of Rochester. They kicked me out (I graduated), but I’m still here, auditing courses for the fall. I’m taking Environmental Economics, Environmental Law and Policy, and Web Design. Why? Because I think they’ll be useful if I do anything sustainability-related in my career. And because it buys me more time to figure out what I want to do with my life. I don’t know what will happen after this fall… I guess sooner or later I need to decide what I’m going to do, at least to start out in a career.</p>

		<h2>Early Life</h2>

			<p>I was born in Boston, MA, but I’ve lived in Rochester, NY since I was 6. I remember a lot from Boston: riding the subways with my brother and dad, going to school, kids’ soccer leagues, babysitters, family friends, playgrounds, and much more. The beginning of Harry Potter is set in my first house, because that’s where my babysitter read it to me. And of course I remember my family – my mom, dad, and older brother – but they came with me to Rochester.</p>

		<h2>School Years</h2>

			<p>In elementary school I was a pretty busy kid. Both my parents worked full time, so after school I went to an after-school program until about 6pm. Then, most nights we’d come home for a rushed dinner and then drive off again for some activity: soccer, gymnastics, basketball, swimming, violin lessons, violin classes, or my brother’s baseball games. In the summer and during school breaks my brother and I went to camps: music camps, gymnastics camp, sports camp, chess camp, “fun camp” (or “boring camp” as my brother called it), and others. But what I did more than anything was read.</p>

			<p>In middle school and high school I didn’t do sports, but I filled my time with homework and violin, and school clubs to some extent. I was a very… slow… worker… so I spent a lot of time doing homework. I also did more orchestras, violin group classes, and started practicing violin a little more seriously (sometimes), so that took more time too. My favorite thing from high school was being in a classical music improvisation group, with some of my best friends.</p>

		<h2>College</h2>

			<p>College was the first time that I could choose pretty much all of what I wanted to study, and I loved that. Every semester I spent hours and hours looking at the course catalogs, emailing professors for syllabi, sitting in on way more courses than I was going to take, and trying to make decisions (which I’m bad at). I didn’t declare my major until fall of my junior year, when I created my own major (so I never really decided anyway). Although the library has been my second home, I’ve also been pretty involved in a couple clubs (Students for a Democratic Society, Greenspace, and Partners in Reading especially), and kept up violin for the first three years.</p>
